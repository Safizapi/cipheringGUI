# cipheringGui
This project uses Flet framework for its GUI as I considered it to be the easiest way for me. I made it for fun to "privately" talk in public with my friends on discord. Also it had some issues while compiling to exe because of several files in the project so that can be easily done by putting EVERYTHING in a single file, but I don't want to do it so you can read the whole code with comfort (posting the exe anyway).
